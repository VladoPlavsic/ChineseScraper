# ChineseScraper

To change path for your output directory go to Srcaper/App.config file and change value of "Path"..."Path".

Note#1: You should have gecodriver for program to work. (It would be done without using selenium, but the purpose of this project is "showing of (as I understod it))
 
Note#2: There might be an error (probably not) in Program.cs trying to load .config file due to the project was done in Rider on Linux, and it doesn't allow us using Config file as Visual Studio does!
